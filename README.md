# Call-Center
The "Call Center" program is one of the projects I worked on in my Java-based Data Structures & Algorithms class in Spring 2025. It's a simulation of a call center that implements a FIFO (First In First Out) queue using arrays to keep track of calls and answer calls at the front of the queue.  
In this course, I learned how to use JUnit 4 to test code in my programs and make sure they function correctly. I demonstrate using that framework in the CallTest and CallCenterTest files.
